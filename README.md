# AlphaUnit

This repository is related to the Alpha Unit distribution which holds two main files <RandomGen.R>, random generator, and <AU-inference.R>, file for classic and Bayesian inference. As an exemplification, we adopted the dataset from the Chilean Inflation from 1992 til 2021 <InflationUnit.csv>, where all values were standardized adopting the maximum value from the post-military era (from the '90 beyond).
